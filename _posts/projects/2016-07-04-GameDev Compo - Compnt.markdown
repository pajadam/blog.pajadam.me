    Compnt - the game written in 7 days, in Java using LibGDX graphics library. 
    Ugliest code I've ever written! My first project using Java... Java is not that bad.
    I've never had bigger problems with it. The game took 3rd (last) place. 
    Gameplay is simple. You need to tap rectangles untill you achieve state 
    from the picture. Nothing fancy. Check out links below - you can try it yourself.
