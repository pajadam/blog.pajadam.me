<p>
    My VPS had a problem with shutdown and reboot for a long time.
    I tried to fix it earlier, unsuccessfully.
    Maybe Ubuntu 16.04 hanged when systemd was stopping services?
    I logged into DigitalOcean console and there was no errors.
    I had no clue why it does not work, so I've started digging...
</p>

<div class="info">
    Let's fix it!
</div>

<p>
    First of all - logs. I checked all logs from time when I issued reboot command.
    Nothing special, no errors. I decided to stop all services 
    installed by me manually ( e.g. nginx ) and tried reboot again - with no success.
    I thought that it may be caused by <em>systemd</em> waiting for service to stop. 
    Last time I was waiting only 1 minute, till I forced server reboot, 
    so next time I gave it more time. Additionally I've changed <em>systemd</em> stop timeout:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# /etc/systemd/system.conf

#DefaultTimeoutStopSec=90s
DefaultTimeoutStopSec=15s
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
    Now I was waiting 30 mins and nothing happens... again. But before
    forcing reboot, I looked at the console output and noticed something interesting...
    One line of the console output was strange. Normally <em>systemd</em> informs you when service stopped successfully or not. 
    But this line was not followed by <em>"[ OK ] Stopped"</em> or even <em>"[FAILED]"</em> message.
    It was something like this ( may be inaccurate, I forgot to take a screenshot ):
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# successfully stopped some
# other services, but never
# stopped ... rc.local ...
...
         Stopping ... rc.local ...
         Stopping nginx...
         Stopping transmission-daemon...
[  OK  ] Stopped nginx.
[  OK  ] Stopped transmission-daemon.
# hanged there.
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
    It was a last clue... I needed to check what's going on in <em>rc.local</em> file. 
    Let's find out what's in here...
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/sh -e
#
# rc.local
#
# ...
#

uwsgi --ini /etc/uwsgi/emperor.ini  --touch-reload=/home/django/sac-webapp/reload.ini &

exit 0
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
    There was a startup script for my <em>UWSGI</em> server.
    Nothing special, I was wondering how it could prevent my server reboot. 
    I removed this line and tried to reboot...
    Fail. Ubuntu hangs out again... I decided to give it a last try,
    just to make sure... and BOOM! Reboot complete correctly in less than 30s! <b>Problem solved</b>!
</p>

<div class="info">
    Now it works like a charm!
</div>

<p>
    But hey... what about <em>UWSGI</em>? It must be started automatically.
    Quick Google session -> cron @reboot! Cool, so I've created script 
    called <em>boot.sh</em> in my <em>"~/tools"</em> directory with uwsgi start command, and
    finally added <em>crontab</em> entry. Remember about correct access rights to script file!
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# /home/pajadam/tools/boot.sh
uwsgi --ini /etc/uwsgi/emperor.ini  --touch-reload=/home/django/sac-webapp/reload.ini &

# sudo crontab -l
...
@reboot '/home/pajadam/tools/boot.sh'
{% endhighlight %}
