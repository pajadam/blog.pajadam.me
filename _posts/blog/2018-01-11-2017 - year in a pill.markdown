    2017 was pretty challenging for me. I've spent my time mostly
    working on my new "big" project. Besides that I've done some
    small things as well.

    At the beginning of 2017 I finally saved enough money to upgrade
    my workspace. I've been switching from old and slow Celeron G1620
    Ivy Bridge CPU to new Z270 platform, but I don't wanted to throw
    all money in my new PC - so I've bought solid base for upgrading
    in future.

MOBO: Gigabyte GA-Z270-HD3P
CPU:  Intel Pentium G4560 CPU
RAM:  HyperX 8GB 2400MHz CL15
SSD:  GoodRAM CX200 120GB
PSU:  Be quiet! System Power 8 400W
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
    It gives me decent performance and of course it's a lot better than G1620 ;)

    Moving on to peripherals. I bought second monitor and replaced my mouse and keyboard.
    I've also mounted my monitors on the wall and I put a mascot on one of them ;)

    I won competition organized by Gynvael on polish livestreams.
    The competition consisted in creation of Blue Screen of Death
    for OS that Gynvael made on Livestream. My entry was the most
    complicated one, as it operates on graphical mode instead of
    text mode. I've managed to modify terminal backend to handle
    graphical mode with proper monospace font rendering.

    I've also successfully tried to solve Gynvael's mission 008 (Polish).

    This year I've made only one website. Unfortunately this is the
    only one website as I was focused on my web application. But I
    think that it looks good, it's simple and clean. It's way better
    than previous one.

<div class="sub info">My blog and landing page</div>

<p>
    I've also improved look my blog, but it still lacks some content.
    I've started upgrading my landing page too! It looks good, but
    it's kinda empty. I'm working on that ;)

    Most of time I was working on my future business. I'm creating
    application since Q3 of 2016. There's a hole in the market and
    I plan to make use of it as good as possible. Nothing similar
    ever existed so I hope that application will remain the only one
    existing solution.
</p>

<div class="sub info">Beginnings</div>

<p>
    Project started from idea of one of my earlier client, that I've done
    website for. I teamed up with him to get more informations about industry
    needs, feature request, get some feedback and testing in action. I've done
    a lot of research from technical side to pick technologies matching project
    needs. I finally chose Django with Postgres as database, and Semantic UI as
    a frontend framework. I don't regret this choice - huge extendability, decent
    performance and low entry point - they speak for themselves. The work has
    been started...
</p>

<div class="sub info">Current state</div>

<p>
    Now, application is used on production for about 4 months now, but still
    remains unreleased. I'm constantly improving and extending its features,
    while listening to feedback and ideas too.
</p>

<p>
    I don't want to talk about functionality of this project yet.
    There's still a lot to be done. I don't even have a proper branding
    such as logo, project name and promotional page. The proper project
    announcement will probably take place at the end of Q2 2018.
</p>

<p>
    I've learned a lot during this project, and this is just the beginning.
    It still needs some features, branding and UI improvements. I've also
    need to dig into marketing of this kind of projects. I will try to share
    my experiences through my blog, but no promises. I'm not a good blogger ;)
</p>

<div class="info">Summary</div>

<p>
    I'm not entirely happy with this year. I've done quite a lot in my main project,
    but I've also wasted too much time on useless ideas, that ended up deleted and
    forgotten. Hopefully I won't repeat my mistakes - lessons have been learned.
    I will take them into account in the new year ;)
